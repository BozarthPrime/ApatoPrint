A Slack bot to remotely control and check in on your 3D printers securely.

## How it works
ApatoPrint is a nodejs application that runs alongside OctoPrint that connects to the OctoPrint API and the Slack API as a Slack bot. You set up a private channel for it to accept commands from and only add in people you would like to be able to control the printers. From there you can send it commands to do various things like stopping, starting, and getting status updates.

## Why the name?
As it turns out naming something is one of the hardest parts of any project for me. I landed here because I wanted some form of animal logo and dinosaurs are pretty great. Also I found a good apatosaurus image on OpenClipArt.

## What is still to come in this project?
In its current state this is an add-on to OctoPrint that does make it completely controllable via slack. It has a few rough edges I am working on and I would like to add a few more features but it is getting there. What I would like to evolve this project into is a full print server that does not rely on OctoPrint to do the printer control.
